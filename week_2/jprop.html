                    <p>The following devil sticks are available at a special discount for the entire month of May:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Basic Stick ($19.95)</strong>
                            The easiest stick to learn with, but “grippy” enough for the most demanding tricks. Comes in red, green, and blue.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            A graceful stick with colored tassels. Flower Sticks float slowly, making them ideal for beginners.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Master Stick ($39.95)</strong>
                            Our most popular stick is shorter and heavier for fast play and more advanced tricks. Each Master Stick is available in custom colors.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Glow Stick ($29.95)</strong>
                            The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without the danger of a fire stick).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Quality Tested</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every item I create is checked and tested before being shipped out to assure perfect quality. I take pride in every one of my juggling props and I want my customers to feel that
                        same pride.
